The program is fully functional with the data stored in metals.db and ligands.db. If the user wishes to add additional metals or ligands, the corresponding overlay interfaces can be used. It should be noted that the metal–geometry combinations included were selected based on entries in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). If the user chooses to incorporate a different geometry for a given metal, it cannot be guaranteed that corresponding reference data exist in the CSD, which may compromise comparability. It should also be noted, that the metals given in the database expand the elements of the 8th to 12th group and also include the elements of the groups 3 to 7. This is due to the cooperation with Florian Voß, who is the co developer of this programm. The script "StartUp.py" is responsible for generating the different ligand-metal combinations for each geometry. Here, the positions of the bonding atoms of the ligands are given for each geometry, also
